Welcome to the Unofficial Wine Overlay!
=======================================

Repoman Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NP-Hardass/wine-overlay.svg?branch=wine-a-holics)](https://travis-ci.org/NP-Hardass/wine-overlay)

Goals
-----
This overlay strives to provide bleeding edge Wine and Wine related ebuilds,
hopefully with them being accepted into the main Gentoo tree.  Additionally,
we aim to improve ebuild quality, squash bugs, and implement a slotted Wine
(exclusive for this overlay) that will enable users to use multiple
versions of Wine, with and without Wine-Staging, at the same time.  We know
that Wine sometimes includes regressions from version to version, so the
the goal there is to allow you to switch and use whatever version(s) that
your applications need.
